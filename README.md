## Introduction
After seeing [Clement's](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer) pathfiner app I knew I wanted to implement one myself but using modern frameworks, technologies and design.

[Pathfinder Visualizer](https://pathfinder-visualizer-five.vercel.app/) is an application that aims to help users understand how various pathfinding algorithms work by visualizing them in real time.

## Overview
- Interactive grid for creating obstacles and defining weighted edges connecting the nodes.
- Real-time animations.
- Responsive design, compatible with various screen sizes.

## Available Algorithms
### Pathfinding
1. [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
2. [A* (A-Star) Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)
3. [Bi-Directional A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_search)
4. [BFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)
5. [DFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)

### Maze Generation
1. Recursive Backtracking Algorithm ("Randomized Depth-First search")
2. Randomized Prim Algorithm

## Tech Used
- TypeScript
- React
- Next.js
- TailWindCSS
- Framer Motion
