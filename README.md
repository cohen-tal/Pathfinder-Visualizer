# Pathfinder Visualizer 

## Introduction
After seeing [Clement's](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer) pathfiner app I knew I wanted to implement one myself but using modern frameworks, technologies and design.

Pathfinder Visualizer is an application that aims to help users understand how various pathfinding algorithms work by visualizing them in real time.

## Overview
- Interactive grid for creating obstacles and defining weighted edges connecting the nodes.
- Real-time animations.
- Responsive design, compatible with various screen sizes.

## Available Algorithms
### Pathfinding
1. [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
2. [A* (A-Star) Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)
3. [Bi-Directional A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_search)
4. [BFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)
5. [DFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)

### Maze Generation
1. Recursive Backtracking Algorithm ("Randomized Depth-First search")
2. Randomized Prim Algorithm

## Tech Used
- TypeScript
- React
- Next.js
- TailWindCSS
- Framer Motion
